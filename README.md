# README.md for NixOS Configuration with virtualization and GPU acceleration using Home Manager and Flakes

## Introduction

This repository offers a simple yet powerful way to install and configure a NixOS environment tailored to a modern linux desktop workflow with GPU acceleration for containers and virtual environments. It leverages NixOS's reproducibility and the flake system to create a consistent and portable setup.

## Quick Start

1. **Initial Installation**: Install a minimal ISO NixOS from [NixOS Download](https://nixos.org/download).
2. **Network Connection**: Connect with an Ethernet cable or use Network Monitor CLI `nmcli device wifi connect <mySSID> password <myPassword>` for a wireless connection.
3. **Download `flake.nix` to `/etc/nixos/`**:
   ```bash
   # Change to the NixOs configuration working directory.
   cd /etc/nixos
   # Open a temporary shell with wget to fetch web files.
   nix-shell -p wget
   sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fursman/NixOS/main/flake.nix
   ```
5. **Apply Configuration**: Rebuild NixOS with flakes, home manager and custom configurations.
   ```bash
   # Must be executed from within the /etc/nixos working directory.
   "sudo nixos-rebuild --flake .#desktop switch"
   ```
