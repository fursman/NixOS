## Project Overview
This project configures a robust and flexible NixOS desktop environment. It leverages Nix Flakes for reproducible builds and Home Manager for user-specific configurations, ensuring a consistent and customizable experience across systems.

## Installation Instructions

2. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repository/nixos-desktop.git`
3. Enter the project directory: `cd nixos-desktop`
4. To build and activate the configuration: `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#desktop`

## Configuration Details
### Flake.nix
The `flake.nix` file defines the project's dependencies and configurations. It includes:
- Nixpkgs tracking the `nixos-unstable` branch for the latest packages.
- Home Manager for managing user-specific configurations.
- External resources like CSS for Waybar and scripts for weather information.

### Desktop.nix
The `desktop.nix` file sets up the desktop environment. It includes:
- Configuration for Wayland and Hyprland as the window manager.
- A variety of desktop applications such as Kitty, Firefox, and Thunar.
- Custom settings for appearance, including themes and icons.

## Usage Instructions
Once installed, the desktop environment can be accessed normally through NixOS. Use the configured keybindings and applications as per your requirements.

## Customization
Users can customize the configuration by editing the `desktop.nix` and `flake.nix` files. Changes like modifying the window manager settings or adding new packages can be done here.
